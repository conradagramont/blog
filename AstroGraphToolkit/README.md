# AstroGraphToolkit

AstroGraphToolkit is a sample web site that shows how to use the Microsoft Graph Toolkit for client side integration with Microsoft 365. 

The site is based on [Astro](https://astro.build) with minimal additions to show how the static content is updated base on client side interactions with the Microsoft Graph Toolkit.

Deployment of the site has zero requirements to be deployed within Microsoft Azure.  Thus, it could be deployed on a local server, Amazon 
Web Services, Vercel, Netlify, etc.  Regardless of where it's deployed, authentication and Microsoft Graph interactions will work.

Unlike a previous blog post, [Using Microsoft Entra Id EasyAuth with Astro and Azure Static Web App](https://agramont.net/blog/entra-id-easyauth-with-astro), the authentication is not based on, nor requires, configuration and deployment of Azure Static Web App.
