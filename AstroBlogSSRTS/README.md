# AstroBlogSSRTS

This quick little example shows a few basic changes to the Astro Blog sample files required to run Astro in SSR server output mode with TypeScript support.

Features:

- âœ… Astro Blog example modified to work with SSR 
- âœ… Runs with Node working with Typescript

Tested with version:
- Astro: 4.11.5
- Node: v18.20.3 (You'll need this installed to use this project)
- Windows 11: 23H2

## File Changes

Here's what to look for to help you on your journey:
- astro.config.mjs
  - SSR configuration
- package.json
  - scripts: added one called node that will build and run using nodemon
  - nodemonConfig: settings for nodemon
  - dependencies: @astrojs/node
  - devDependencies: @types/node, nodemon, ts-node, typescript
  - nodemon configuration
- src\pages\blog\[...slug].astro
  - Modified to change how SSR handles incoming requests versus static site paths

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/

â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
